Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms

• Explored the Machine Learning algorithms on various datasets having 40,000 records (each having 48 features) in csv.

• Implemented Supervised learning algorithms like Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor (from scratch).

• Implemented Dimensionality Reduction using PCA (from scratch).

• Implemented Clustering Analysis using K-means Clustering (from scratch).

• Implemented Evaluation measures like Accuracy, Recall, Precision and Within cluster Sum of squares on the algorithms developed from scratch.

• Implemented supervised learning algorithms like SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision tree, KNN and created an ensemble model using the voting classifier of them (using SciKit-Learn).

• Created visualization using Matplotlib library, of the confusion matrix for each of the 5 classifiers.
